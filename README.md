Project Description:
Abstract. The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and education
is transforming learning and teaching, with generative AI and large lan-
guage models (LLMs) offering new possibilities. AI and LLMs personal-
ize learning through adaptive study guides, instant feedback, automated
grading, and content creation, making resources more accessible and tai-
lored to individual needs. Notably, LLM-based chatbots, such as Ope-
nAI’s ChatGPT, serve as virtual assistants, ideal for language practice.
However, these chatbots often limit themselves to teaching vocabulary
through role-playing conversations or providing instant feedback based
on model-generated content, which may lead to exposure to inaccuracies.
This overlooks the holistic nature of language learning, which includes
pedagogy, effective methods, reliable content, and a supportive teacher-
student relationship. Relying on a single chatbot is inefficient for the en-
tire learning process. A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is proposed, where
each agent specializes in a specific function, working together to provide
personalized, adaptive learning support. This approach breaks down the
complex learning process into manageable parts. It employs the Busi-
ness Process Model and Notation (BPMN), translated into agent-based
modeling and LLMs to create dynamic, tailored learning environments.
By simulating interactions similar to human tutoring, this model ensures
real-time adjustments to meet each student’s evolving needs.
Our project aims to address these limitations by using language learn-
ing books with robust pedagogical resources as primary references. We
focus on teaching Luxembourgish, adding complexity to our challenges
as it is a low-resource language, ensuring a holistic learning experience.
Our approach employs complex LLM workflows as multi-agent collabo-
rations for reading, conversing, listening, and mastering grammar, based
on GPT-4o, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
voice recognition features.
